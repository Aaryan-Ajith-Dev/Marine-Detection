# Faster R-CNN for Small Object Detection in Marine Drone Imagery

This project implements and fine-tunes a Faster R-CNN model using PyTorch's `torchvision` library for detecting small marine life in aerial drone images.

The model was developed as part of an industry project focused on automated monitoring of marine environments. The primary challenge tackled was the detection of small, low-contrast marine species in complex underwater or ocean surface backgrounds.

## Features
- Fine-tuned Faster R-CNN with customized anchor settings for small object detection.
- Weighted sampling to handle class imbalance.
- Custom IoU computation for evaluation.
- Visualizations of detections using `PIL` and `matplotlib`.
- Clean training loop using PyTorch best practices.
- Anomaly Detection pipeline using PaDiM (for outlier region identification).

## Architecture
- Backbone: ResNet50
- Detection Head: Custom FastRCNNPredictor
- RPN: Custom Anchor Generator optimized for small objects
- Dataset Format: COCO-style annotations

## Anomaly Detection with PaDiM
Alongside Faster R-CNN, this project also explores anomaly detection using the PaDiM (Patch Distribution Modeling) method to identify outlier regions in drone imagery â€” useful for spotting unusual marine activity or unidentified species.

### Highlights
- Used pre-trained ResNet-18 feature extractor.
- Modeled patch-wise feature distributions.
- Generated heatmaps highlighting anomalous regions.
- Visual evaluation of anomaly maps on marine drone images.

## Dataset
Dataset used in this project belongs to the organization and is not publicly available.

To replicate this work, public datasets like the NOAA Fisheries Dataset or AI for Earth Wildlife Detection datasets can be adapted.

## Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning for better small object detection.
- Experimenting with RetinaNet / EfficientDet.
- Deployment-ready inference pipeline.
- Integrating active learning for faster dataset curation.
